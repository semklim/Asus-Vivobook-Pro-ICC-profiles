# Asus Vivobook M3500QC/M3500QA OLED ICC Profiles

This repository contains the default ICC profiles for the **Asus Vivobook M3500QC OLED** and **M3500QA OLED** laptops. These profiles are factory-calibrated and provided by Asus through the **MyASUS Splendid Version V2.0.0.145** utility on Windows.

## Why This Repository Exists

If you're using Linux, obtaining these profiles directly from Asus is not possible since they are distributed only via the Windows utility. This repository makes it easy for Linux users (and anyone else) to download and apply these ICC profiles to ensure accurate color calibration on their OLED displays.

## Source of the Profiles

The profiles were extracted from a Windows system after installing **MyASUS Splendid Version V2.0.0.145**. These are the same ICC profiles provided by Asus for the respective laptop models.
